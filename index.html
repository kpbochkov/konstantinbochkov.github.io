    <section id="about">
        <p>Hello! I am Konstantin Bochkov, a software engineer currently <a href="#current-work">working at A1</a> on their Border Crossing project for the Bulgarian government.
            Previously, I <a href="#past-work">worked at Tinqin</a>, right after graduating from Telerik Academy with Java. I enjoy programming and have a deep passion for Java, though I’ve also explored
            JavaScript, Python, and dabbled with Scheme. But at the end of the day—Java rules!</p>
        <p>I’m grateful that at 36, I’m still an avid learner, and I hope my curiosity and passion for learning continue for a lifetime!
            I strive to improve my <a href="#software-learning">software engineering skills</a> every day. Over the past two decades, my interests have also included
            <a href="#other-learning">swimming</a>, <a href="#other-learning">chess</a>, and <a href="#other-learning">psychology</a>.
            Recently, I’ve developed new passions for <a href="#other-learning">cycling</a> and the <a href="#other-learning">Chinese language</a>! If you’re curious about my journey, check out the <a href="#learning">My Learning</a> section.</p>

        <h2>My Current Work</h2>
        <p>The project digitalizes the Bulgarian border crossing system by implementing queue and traffic management services.
            Built on Java 21, the coolest thing is that we developed it from scratch! Learn more in my <a href="resume.pdf" target="_blank">resume</a>.</p>

    <section id="past-work">
        <h2>My Past Work</h2>
        <p>Before joining A1, I worked at Tinqin, where I gained valuable experience in software development and honed my Java skills.
            My time there shaped my approach to writing clean, efficient code and collaborating on challenging projects.</p>

        <h2 id="software-learning">Software Engineering Learning</h2>
        <p>I’m constantly improving my skills as a software engineer. Learning software engineering is an endless, fun experience!
            From the start, my goal has been to master the fundamentals deeply. I enjoy reading software engineering books and am following
            Bozhidar Batsov’s recommended book list from his famous talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6OQ2RESp4s" target="_blank">(watch here)</a>—I’ve already completed over 50% of the list!</p>
        <p>In 2023, I discovered an amazing free online course based on Berkeley’s CS61B—<a href="https://sp24.datastructur.es/" target="_blank">Data Structures and Algorithms</a>.
            Last year, I explored these topics deeply and completed most of the course projects <a href="https://github.com/kpbochkov/cs61b-sp24" target="_blank">(check them out)</a>.
            I also explored <a href="https://cs61a.org/" target="_blank">CS61A</a>, covering Scheme and Python with the famous book *Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs*—quite a challenge for me!</p>
        <p>My next goal is to dive into C through <a href="https://cs61c.org/sp25/" target="_blank">CS61C</a> course and learn more about operating systems.</p>

        <h2 id="other-learning">Other Interests</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Chess:</strong> I spent five years studying chess in my twenties, reading books, and learning from top players online. Now, I play occasionally for fun.</li>
            <li><strong>Chinese Language:</strong> Currently studying Chinese with the goal of achieving HSK5 proficiency. It’s a fun challenge!</li>
            <li><strong>Psychology:</strong> I studied Psychology at a French university, specializing in Work and Organizational Psychology. A lifelong passion!</li>
            <li><strong>Swimming:</strong> After years of water polo, I realized my technique was awful! I now study swimming rigorously and analyze my strokes for improvement.</li>
            <li><strong>Cycling:</strong> A newfound passion that keeps me active. Next challenge—bikepacking!</li>
